# Hangman-project documentation
This file provides a brief documentation on the steps undertaken to finish Hangman project

## Milestone 2
Defined a variable with a list of words. Have asked user for an input and validated that it is a single letter. In terms of concepts, have applied loops and input function so far. And learning how to document it in Github

## Milestone 3
Defined two functions - one to check if the guessed letter is in the randomly chosen word, and another to ask for user input and check if it is part of the random word. Screenshot below

## Milestone 4 - Creating class and methods
Created a class called Hangman with five attributes. 
Created two object methods check_guess and ask_for_input which updates the class attributes, checks for validity of inputs and whether it is a valid guess

Added to it a new method called play_game to actually help play game with users. 
Added all docstrings to explain classes and methods in the file
Screenshot too long to put here
